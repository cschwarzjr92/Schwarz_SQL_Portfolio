# Schwarz_SQL_Portfolio
# Introduction
This repository contains SQL code that I completed through Career Foundry Data Analytics Bootcamp. It displays what I have learned, my skills and my depth of potential in analytics. The files included are from a project about a fictional video rental company called Rockbuster Stealth. This task familiarized me with SQL queries and databases culminating in an analysis of key business questions.
## Key Questions
- Which movies contributed most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
## Data Set
The project uses a provided database for the fictional comapany Rockbuster Stealth. I used PostgreSQL for queries and analysis.
